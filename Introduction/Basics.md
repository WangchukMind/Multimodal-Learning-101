# Multimodal Learning Basics

## üéØ What is Multimodal Learning?

Multimodal learning leverages information from multiple types of data modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, and video) to build AI systems that better mimic human-like understanding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Techniques:
1. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract meaningful features from each modality.
   - Examples: Text embeddings from BERT, image features from ResNet.

2. **Fusion Techniques:**
   - Combine features across modalities.
   - Common methods: Concatenation, attention-based fusion.

3. **Cross-modal Learning:**
   - Share knowledge and learn relationships across modalities.
   - Example: Text-to-image retrieval.

4. **Modality Alignment:**
   - Align modalities to represent similar information in the same space.
   - Example: CLIP aligns text and image embeddings.

## üöß Challenges in Multimodal Learning
1. **Data Scarcity:** Limited annotated multimodal datasets.
2. **Noise and Redundancy:** Conflicting information between modalities.
3. **Scalability:** High computational cost for large-scale training.
