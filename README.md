## ✨ **What is Multimodal Learning?**

Multimodal learning integrates multiple types of data modalities (e.g., text, image, audio, video) to enhance machine learning systems. It’s widely applied in fields like:
- Autonomous driving (camera + radar + LIDAR)
- Healthcare (MRI scans + patient records)
- Smart assistants (text + voice)
- E-commerce (product search with text and image inputs)
