## âœ¨ What is Multimodal Learning?

Multimodal learning integrates multiple types of data modalities (e.g., text, image, audio, video) to enhance machine learning systems. Itâ€™s widely applied in fields like:
- **Autonomous Driving**: Combining camera, radar, and LIDAR data.
- **Healthcare**: Using MRI scans and patient records for diagnosis.
- **Smart Assistants**: Processing text and voice inputs for human-like interactions.
- **E-commerce**: Enriching product searches with text and image inputs.
